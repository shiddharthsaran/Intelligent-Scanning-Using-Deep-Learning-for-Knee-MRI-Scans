Implementation of the paper: Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee magnetic resonance imaging: Development and retrospective validation of MRNet
To aid in diagnosis,a Deep-learning based model for Intelligent MRI Slice Placement(ISP) for several common knee injuries. We are building a deep-learning classifier consisting of various CNN's to aid in the existing process. We are currently researching various image classification CNN's and also documenting the same for our UG Research Paper.
